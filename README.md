# Science+ Randomizer

Science+ Randomizer is a mod for Kerbal Space Program. It is a sister mod to Science+, and they are intended to be used congruently, though they are not dependant on each other.

This randomizer takes the tech tree and scrambles the nodes around while maintaining the overall shape and path through the tech tree. This is intended to make the game a lot more challenging, especially when paired with the Science+ mod.

Warning: This mod is intended to be used only on new game folders. This mod may very well corrupt your save files that are in the same game folder. Remember to make a backup of your game folder!

## Installation

Simply download scienceplus-randomizer.exe and place it in your KSP game folder (in the same folder as the KSP.exe). You will also need to make an empty folder in your Game Data folder called "Science+ Randomizer", which is where the new tech tree will be created. Then you will need to run the .exe and press the button on the UI. That's it! Good luck!
