# Science+ Randomizer

Science+ Randomizer is a mod for Kerbal Space Program. It is a sister mod to Science+, and they are intended to be used congruently, though they are not dependant on each other.

This randomizer takes the tech tree and scrambles the nodes around while maintaining the overall shape and path through the tech tree. This is intended to make the game a lot more challenging, especially when paired with the Science+ mod.

Warning: This mod is intended to be used only on new game folders. This mod may very well corrupt your save files that are in the same game folder. Remember to make a backup of your game folder!

## Installation

Simply download scienceplus-randomizer.exe and place it in your KSP game folder (in the same folder as the KSP.exe). Then you will need to run the .exe and press the button on the UI. The new Tech Tree will appear in GameData/SciencePlus-Randomizer and you will need to go into GameData/Squad/Resources and delete TechTree.cfg and paste in the randomized Tech Tree. That's it! Good luck!
